What if JavaScript was as simple as `2 + 2` is `4`?<!--more-->

## Numbers and operators

## Words

The *natural words*.

```js
"Hello world !!!"
'Hello world !!!'
`Hello world !!!`
```

```js
"Hello" + "world !!!"
```

`"Helloworld !!!"` and not `"Hello world !!!"`

```js
"Hello " + "world !!!"
"Hello" + " world !!!"
"Hello" + " " + "world !!!"
```

## The "unnaturals words"

Here we are. That's where programming really begins, with the *programmatic words*.

Keywords and names.

```js
const a = 42;
```

```js
const a = 42;
const a=42; 
```

`2 + 2` is like `2+2`: spaces have no impact when around operators.
On this point, operators are like punctuation.
`"Hi. How are you?"` is like `"Hi. How are you ?"` or `"Hi.How are you?"`.
BUT you feel more comfortable with one of these strings: the other ones .

That's for operators. What about words? Take the time to compare the following lines:

```js
const a = 42;
consta = 42;
```

I'm sure you will agree: `"Hello world !!!"` is definitly not `"Helloworld !!!"`.
Adding, moving or removing spaces in words alters how the words are delimited.
So the words which are identifed in the "sentence", and so the meaning of the sentence itself.
